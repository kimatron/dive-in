# TESTING.md

## Overview

This document details the testing process, methodologies, and results for the Full-Stack Web application. The goal is to ensure that the application meets the specified requirements, is fully functional, and provides a smooth and secure user experience.

### Learning Outcomes Addressed

- **LO1**: Application designed and developed using Agile methodology and MVC framework.
- **LO2**: Implementation of a data model, application features, and business logic.
- **LO3**: Application of authentication, authorization, and permission features.
- **LO4**: Creation of manual and automated tests.
- **LO5**: Use of version control with Git and GitHub.
- **LO6**: Deployment of the application to a cloud-based platform.
- **LO7**: Understanding and use of object-based software concepts.

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing

Manual testing was conducted to validate user interactions, data handling, and overall application behavior. Each feature and user story was manually tested to ensure it met the acceptance criteria.

**Tools Used:**

- **Agile Tool**: For tracking user stories and testing progress.
- **Django Admin**: For backend testing of models and admin actions.
- **Browser Developer Tools**: For inspecting frontend elements and console errors.

### Automated Testing

Automated tests were written using Django's testing framework and other relevant tools. These tests focused on verifying the functionality, usability, and data management processes of the application. Unfortunately, though I tried to use automated testing, and tried various codes I couldn't get the automated testing to work properly as I was getting error messages when trying to create a test database:

- **Automated testing fail**: ![Automated testing fail](static/images/documentation/automatedtestingfail.png)

**Python Tests:**

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components such as models, views, and forms.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensuring that components work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validating the complete user workflow from start to finish.

### Browser and Device Compatibility Testing

The application was tested across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent performance and responsiveness.

**Browsers Tested:**

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

**Devices Tested:**

- Desktop (Windows, macOS)
- Tablet (iOS, Android)
- Mobile (iOS, Android)

## Bugs Fixed

During the development and testing phases of the Dive In blog, several issues were identified and addressed. Below is a summary of the bugs that were fixed, along with descriptions of the problems and their resolutions.

### 1. Error 502 on GitHub Repository Access

**Issue:** While trying to access the GitHub repository, users encountered a "502 Bad Gateway" error.

**Resolution:** 
- Verified GitHub repository URL and correct any typographical errors.
- Checked network settings and GitHub status page for outages.
- Ensured the repository permissions were properly set.

### 2. Authentication Failure on Sign-in Page

**Issue:** Users were unable to sign in due to authentication failures, receiving an error message.

**Resolution:**
- Reviewed and updated authentication backend configurations.
- Ensured that user credentials were correctly validated against the database.
- Fixed issues related to session management and cookie settings.

### 3. Blog Post Image Upload Issue

**Issue:** Images were not uploading correctly to blog posts, causing broken image links.

**Resolution:**
- Updated image upload handling code to ensure proper file storage and retrieval.
- Configured Django settings for static and media file handling.
- Verified that image paths and URLs were correctly managed in the database.

### 4. Inconsistent Layout Across Browsers

**Issue:** The blog layout appeared differently across various web browsers, affecting user experience.

**Resolution:**
- Standardized CSS using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to ensure consistent styling.
- Conducted cross-browser testing and applied necessary adjustments for compatibility.
- Fixed layout issues related to browser-specific CSS quirks.

### 5. Broken Links in Navigation Menu

**Issue:** Several links in the navigation menu were not functioning, leading to 404 errors.

**Resolution:**
- Checked and updated navigation links in the HTML templates.
- Ensured that URLs in the menu corresponded to existing pages and views.
- Added error handling to manage and log broken link occurrences.

### 6. Comments Section Not Displaying

**Issue:** Comments on blog posts were not displaying, leading to a lack of user interaction.

**Resolution:**
- Debugged and fixed issues related to the comment rendering logic.
- Ensured comments were correctly retrieved from the database and displayed on the post pages.
- Verified that comment form submissions were properly processed and stored.

### 7. Incomplete User Profile Information

**Issue:** User profiles were not showing complete information, such as profile pictures and bios.

**Resolution:**
- Updated the `UserProfile` model and associated views to handle and display all profile fields.
- Ensured that profile data was correctly stored and retrieved from the database.
- Fixed issues with form handling for profile updates.

### 8. Deployment Configuration Errors

**Issue:** Errors occurred during the deployment process, causing the live site to fail.

**Resolution:**
- Reviewed and corrected deployment configurations, including environment variables and settings.
- Addressed issues related to database migrations and static file collection.
- Conducted end-to-end tests to ensure successful deployment.

### 9. Comment Approval Feature Not Working

**Issue:** The comment approval feature was not functioning, allowing unapproved comments to be visible.

**Resolution:**
- Debugged the comment approval logic in the backend.
- Updated views and templates to correctly handle comment approval statuses.
- Added additional validation to ensure that only approved comments were displayed.

## Known Bugs Not Fixed

### 1. Collaboration Function Not Working Correctly

**Description:** The collaboration feature, which allows multiple users to edit a blog post simultaneously, is currently experiencing issues. Some users report that their changes are not being saved or are being overwritten by others.

**Status:** Under Investigation

**Image Placeholder:**

![Collaboration Bug](#) <!-- Replace # with the image URL or path -->

**Notes:** This bug appears sporadically and is difficult to replicate consistently, making it challenging to diagnose and resolve. We are working to identify the root cause and will update this section once more information is available.

### 2. HTML Validation Errors Due to Django and Bootstrap

**Description:** Running the site through the W3C Nu HTML Checker flags several validation errors. However, I think these errors stem from Django’s templating syntax and Bootstrap’s pre-defined classes rather than actual issues within the custom code, as when I search for the code causing the errors in my code they do not appear.

**Status:** Unfixable Due to Framework Constraints

**Image Placeholder:**

![HTML Validation Errors](#)

**Notes:** The reported validation errors do not correspond to any identifiable code in the project when searched. These errors are artifacts of using Bootstrap's pre-defined classes and Django's templating engine, which often injects code in ways that cause false positives in HTML validation.

## 3. Subscription Model Not Fully Implemented

**Description:** The subscription model, which is intended to allow users to subscribe to updates and notifications, is not fully implemented. Certain features, such as subscription management and notification settings, are incomplete.

**Status:** In Progress

**Notes:** The subscription model is partially implemented, and work is ongoing to complete the feature. The current implementation allows users to subscribe but lacks full functionality for managing subscriptions and notifications.

## Styling-errors:

- Last-minute changes changed the style of my containers, and they looks more squished than I would like. In my last minute deployed site the author image is not displaying, I can not figure out why as it worked fine before, and it is displaying ok when it is ran locally with Debug set to True, and not when it is set to false. I have collected static, which fixed this issue before, but unfortunately it's not working in this moment.
